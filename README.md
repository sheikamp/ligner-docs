<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are already a lot of sites and apps available that revolve around reading.
Goodreads puts a focus on keeping track of what you want to read and what you have read in the past.
It also has a big community and shows you recommendations based on your reading history.
There is also a possibility to set a yearly reading challenge, but that is all in terms of gamification.

In contrast Ligner (from French LIre + gaGNER, read and win) only focuses on that part.
The goal is to manage your shelves, sure, but more importantly offer leagues that you participate in, 
award badges and achievements for certain tasks and everything you've come to love from your favorite multiplayer games.

There is a similar service called BookSloth, but since this is just a showcase project it does not really matter if it will ever be successful.
